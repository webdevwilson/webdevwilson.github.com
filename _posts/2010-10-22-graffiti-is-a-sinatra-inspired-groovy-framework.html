Playing around with Sinatra the other day and realized I could really use something like this for Groovy.  Thus, Graffiti was born.  It's basically a thin wrapper around Jetty.  At first, I thought I might write my own server for it (everybody needs to do that once, don't they?), but decided to invoke the <a href="http://c2.com/xp/DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">'simplest thing that could possibly work' principle</a>.

Here is the requisite 'Hello World' example:

<script src="/js/syntaxhighlighter_2.1.364/scripts/shBrushGroovy.js"></script>
<pre class="brush: groovy">import graffiti.*

@Grab('com.goodercode:graffiti:1.0-SNAPSHOT')
@Get('/helloworld')
def hello() {
  'Hello World'
}

Graffiti.serve this</pre>
The code, plus more documentation is hosted under <a href="http://github.com/webdevwilson">my github account</a>.
