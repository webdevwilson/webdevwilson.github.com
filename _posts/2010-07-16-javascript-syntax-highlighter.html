<p>I just want to do a quick shout out to Alex Gorbatchev for his most excellent <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/" target="_blank">Javascript syntax highlighter</a>.&#160; I installed it to the blog and am very happy about it.&#160; You can now hover over code snippets and copy+paste, view, or print the code.</p>  <p>So, if you have a blog or other use for it, I highly recommend it.</p>
