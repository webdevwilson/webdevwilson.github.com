<pre class="brush: xml">
   <div class="i-float-left">
     some text
   </div>
   <div style="clear: both;"></div>
</pre>

<p></p>

<p>This never really sit well with me.&#160; Recently, I decided to try and find a better way to accomplish this with a CSS class.&#160; In so doing I came across <a href="http://positioniseverything.net/easyclearing.html" target="_blank">this post</a>.&#160; If you want to know a bunch of stuff about why this trick works I suggest you read the post.&#160; I will summarize by saying that this trick uses the :after CSS pseudo-selector which is not currently recognized by IE.&#160; But, conveniently we can make ie execute the behavior by assigning a 'zoom' to it.&#160; A css attribute that is ignored by other browsers but makes IE render it differently.&#160; Hear is the css code.</p>

<pre class="brush: css">
.clearme { zoom: 1; }
.clearme:after { content: "."; display: block; height: 0; clear: both; visibility: hidden } 
</pre>

<p>Then, you assign an element to be cleared by adding the 'clearme' class.</p>

<pre class="brush: xml">
  <div class="i-float-left clearme">
    some text
  </div>
</pre>

<p>And everything following will clear the floating div.&#160; I have verified this works in IE 6, IE 7, IE 8, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari (mac).</p>
