<p>Ever see a nifty tool that solves a problem for a particular domain that you may never encounter but wish you had a reason to use it?</p>  <p>I did that recently with this <a href="http://vinapi.skizmo.com/" target="_blank">VIN API</a> by the people at the <a href="http://pullmonkey.com/" target="_blank">PullMonkey blog</a>.&#160; It will easily decode a VIN, returning the make, model, year, and other useful information about the vehicle.&#160; It was developed for Mr Quotey, a new <a href="http://mrquotey.com/" target="_blank">free online insurance service</a>.</p>  <p><a href="http://pullmonkey.com/2010/02/19/vin-api-vin-decoder-for-anyone/" target="_blank">Check out the post</a> if you would like to try it out, it even provides a simple example written in Ruby.</p>
