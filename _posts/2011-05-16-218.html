I have recently begun using the <a href="http://www.pomodorotechnique.com/">Pomodoro Technique</a> to increase my productivity.  However, I still find myself getting sucked in to the vortex of useless information that is the internet.  With that in mind I began searching for a useful chrome extension to replace the <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=net.artifix.pomodroido.free&feature=search_result">Android Pomodoro app</a> I have been using to manage my 'doros.  I even considered writing it myself.  Luckily, I stumbled on one that had a similar featureset to what I was looking for.

<a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cgmnfnmlficgeijcalkgnnkigkefkbhd">Strict Pomodoro</a> is an excellent Chrome extension for practicing Pomodoro.  Though lacking a few key features, such as the ability to set the duration of your pomodoros and breaks, it still has a key feature that helps me stay on task.  It blocks time sucking websites.  You can set filter lists and it will keep you from accessing them during a Pomodoro.  Effectively reminding you to stay on task.  Also, the author readily admits that it was quickly put together and new features may be added down the road.  For now, it is still an excellent option.

For those of you who do not practice Pomodoro but are trying to stay on task.  The <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji">StayFocusd extension</a> will effectively manage the amount of time you spend on useless (non-productive) sites.  It also has a rich feature set that may be better for your work habits.

OK, breaks over.  Time to get back to work.  25 minutes at a time.
