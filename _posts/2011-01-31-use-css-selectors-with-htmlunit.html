<a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net">HtmlUnit</a> is a great library for performing web integration tests in Java.  But sometimes node traversal can be somewhat cumbersome.  Fear not fellow automated tester (good for you!).  I found a great little project on <a href="http://www.github.com">Github</a> that will allow you to query your document for elements via css selectors similar to <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.

The project is located at <a href="https://github.com/chrsan/css-selectors">https://github.com/chrsan/css-selectors</a>.  You can use Maven to build it, or <a href="/resources/css-selectors-1.0.2.jar">download 1.0.2</a> here.  Beware.  I will not be updating this link so I suggest you download the latest code.

In any case, you can use it like so:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1739887.js?file=html-unit-getting-started.java"></script>

The only problem here is that the querySelectAll returns a Set&lt;Node&gt;.  Not HtmlElement like we may want in some cases.   However, if you were to reflect on the Set, you would find that it is indeed a Set of HtmlElement objects.

Typically, I like to create a base class for my web tests.  Just for fun, I am using the $ method similar to <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1739459.js?file=WebTestBase.java"></script>
Now we can write tests like this:
<pre>public class LoginWebTest extends WebTestBase {

    @Test
    public void login_page_has_instructions() throws Exception {

        goTo(baseUrl + "/login")

        assertThat( $("p.instructions").size(), equalTo(1) );
    }

}</pre>
