<script language="javascript" src="/js/syntaxhighlighter_2.1.364/scripts/shBrushXml.js"></script><script language="javascript" src="/js/syntaxhighlighter_2.1.364/scripts/shBrushPlain.js"></script>I got the following, quite puzzling error today when running a unit test:

<pre class="brush: plain">java.lang.ClassFormatError: Absent Code attribute in method that is not native or abstract in class file javax/servlet/http/Cookie</pre>

A google search found <a href="http://www.andrejkoelewijn.com/wp/2010/03/04/absent-code-attribute-in-method-that-is-not-native-or-abstract/">this post</a>, which explains that it is caused by having an interface in the classpath, and not an actual implementation.

In this case it's the java-ee interface.  To fix this I added the jetty servlet api implementation to my pom:

<pre class="brush: xml">
    <dependency>
        <groupId>jetty</groupId>
        <artifactId>javax.servlet</artifactId>
        <scope>test</scope>
    </dependency>
</pre>

Piece of cake.  I have run in to this before, so I figured I would capture the fix here in case I run in to it again.
