<p>As a developer, what happens when you are running late on a deadline?&#160; Do you work late for more pay?&#160; Do you get chewed out?&#160; What happens if a feature fails to deliver the business value that was expected?&#160; Is it your responsibility?</p>  <p>Too often in the software development industry this is the case.&#160; Developers are not given the respect afforded other professionals.&#160; Instead, there is a perception that they are underperforming, lacking skills, or irresponsible.&#160; There is no concept of total team effort.</p>  <p>What is total team effort?</p>  <p>What if, instead of blaming the developers, missed deadlines are the result of a failure in planning, or a lack of resources?&#160; The failure needs to be identified, and corrected in a respectful manner.&#160; Only then can you take corrective measures to insure it doesn’t happen again.&#160; Does your company have a process for regularly analyzing workflow?&#160; </p>  <p>I recently had a job interview with a company where the representative practically bragged about making their developers work long hours under duress.&#160; This is not an environment I care to subject myself to.&#160; Nor would any other talented developers that I know.&#160; Who suffers?&#160; The business suffers.&#160; Product development suffers.&#160; When we fail to deliver value to the business on a regular basis, they start to question our worth.&#160; It’s a cyclical, self-feeding trend.&#160; One that I don’t want to be a part of, and you shouldn’t either.</p>
