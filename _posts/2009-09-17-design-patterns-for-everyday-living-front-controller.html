<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Controller_pattern">front controller pattern</a> has saved me a ton of time in my recycling efforts.&#160; I started recycling about 2 years ago.&#160; My first procedure was unsatisfactory.&#160; I bought two trash cans, and would put all the trash we identified as recyclable into them.&#160; Once they were full I would take them to the recycling center and put them in the appropriate containers.&#160; The sorting procedure was executed at the facility and everything was sorted at one time.&#160; This was both a time consuming and tedious procedure (kinda gross too).</p>  <p>Enter the front controller patternâ€¦</p>  <p>I decided to buy separate containers and sort trash on the fly.&#160; By moving the sorting procedure to the 'front' of the process, I was able to save time and effort.&#160; Now I spend about 5 minutes at the facility and don't have to handle any stinky trash.&#160; From time to time I see a person who is sorting at the facility.&#160; If only they knew how easy it was to implement the front controller.</p>  <p><em><strong>Design Patterns for Everyday Living</strong> is a regular feature that describes how we can apply software design principles to our daily life.&#160; Saving time, increasing productivity, and gaining a better understanding of their use in the software world.</em></p>  <p><a href="/wp/?cat=22">View more Design Patterns for Everyday Living</a></p>
