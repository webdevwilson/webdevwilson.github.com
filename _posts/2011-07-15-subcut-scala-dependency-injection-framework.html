It's no secret I am a <a href="http://www.goodercode.com/wp/what-are-the-downsides-to-using-dependency-injection/">fan of dependency injection</a>.  So I was happy to hear that Dick Wall of the <a href="http://javaposse.com/" target="_blank">Java Posse</a> recently released a dependency injection framework for scala.  Called SubCut, or Scala Uniquely Bound Classes Under Traits, the project is a 'mix of service locator and dependency injection patterns designed to provide an idiomatic way of providing configured dependencies to scala applications'.

It's hosted on github, so 'git' (rimshot) over there and try it out:
