So it's time for your company to hire someone.  In these tough economic times, you are likely to get thousands of resumes.  From high school dropouts all the way to fresh faced MBA's.  

Who are you going to hire?  

A lot of hiring managers buy in to the notion that some people are 'overqualified'.  They are afraid to hire them for fear they will leave the organization for greener pastures.  They fear the turnover.

Embrace change.  Is it such a bad thing?  In football, many successful teams have a high turnover rate on their coaches.  Other teams will hire their coaches because of their proven success, and the great 'on the job' training they have received.  The best teams become known as much for their success in training coaches as for their 'on the field' accomplishments.  Sure they will leave, but they contribute to the wins and losses while there.

Suppose you hire the new MBA, who then leaves in 6 months for a better job.  What did he or she do while with your organization?  Perhaps, they identified some deficiencies in your process, or came up with a new way to market to your customers.

or

Make the safe hire.  You will probably be able to find an employee that will sit and work for your company for 20 years, doing whatever you tell them to, but never thinking for themselves.

When an employee leaves for greener pastures do you get upset with them, or congratulate them and let them know how much they will be missed?
