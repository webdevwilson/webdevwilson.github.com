I am about to start working on a Python project for work.  So I thought it was probably time to learn Python!  This weekend I took on this task.  I decided to rewrite a library I wrote in PHP to access Zune user data.  I got it finished and decided to <a href="http://github.com/webdevwilson/python-zune">put it on github</a>.

Usage is simple:
<code>
zuneCard = ZuneCard('ZuneTagHere')
</code>

You can access things like user information, favorites, recent plays, and most played.  The properties are documented (pydoc, under /docs).  So for the 1 other person that may use this, you're welcome!
