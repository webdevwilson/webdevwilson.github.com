Those of you who know me, know my favorite music player is the Zune.

For some reason it seems most of my spare time lately seems to be creating Zune API libraries for different languages (I have a PHP one as well).  Here's another one for Ruby!  If you use it, let me know.  I would love to hear what people are working on.

It's hosted at <a href="http://github.com/webdevwilson/ruby-zune">github</a>, and very easy to use.

<script src="/js/syntaxhighlighter_2.1.364/scripts/shBrushRuby.js"></script>
<pre class="brush: ruby">zune_card = Zune::ZuneCard.for('a_zune_tag')</pre>
Checkout the README for deets on what fields the object will have.
