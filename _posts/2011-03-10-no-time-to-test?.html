If I were to guess (and I will), if you asked developers who do not write tests, why they are not writing them.  90% of them would say they do not have enough time.  Most people feel like they hardly have time to write the features, much less the code to properly test them.

<strong>The idea that testing takes a huge amount of time is probably one of the most pervasive myths in our industry.</strong>
