If you are like me you have tons of projects you would like to keep private but track with git, but do not want to pay a git host for a private plan.  One of the problems is that most hosts scale their plans by project instead of users.  Luckily, it is easy to host your own git repositories on any el cheapo host that provides ssh access.

In the interest of full disclosure, I learned this trick from <a href="http://railstips.org/blog/archives/2008/11/23/gitn-your-shared-host-on/">this blog post</a>.  I decided to recreate it in case the source material vanishes for some reason.

To setup your host, login via ssh and run the following commands:

<div>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/1739489.js?file=git-ssl.sh"></script>
</div>

<p>
To keep from entering your password every time add your public key to the server:

Generate your key with '<em>ssh-keygen -t rsa</em>' on your local machine. Â Then add the contents of the generated file to <em>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</em> on your server.
