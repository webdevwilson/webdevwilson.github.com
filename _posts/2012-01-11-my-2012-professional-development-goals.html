<p>Once again I am going to declare some professional goals for my upcoming year.
<ol>
	<li>Convert my blog to Jekyll hosted on github - I am tired of wordpress, tired of spam, and would like to try something new.  I have already started on this.  Just need to finish it up.</li>
	<li>Launch my GWT / Google App Engine application - I am currently developing a GWT application to be deployed to Google App Engine.</li>
	<li>Do another presentation at the user group - At least a few lightning talks.  I have a few ideas.</li>
	<li>Attend a tech conference - Dev Nexus is the likely target</li>
	<li>Post more often - I did 10 posts last year, would like to maybe double that next year (including this one)</li>
	<li>Attend a user group meeting outside of Nashville JUG - A rollover from last year, I will probably be regularly attend the Interactive Developers meeting</li>
	<li>Study another language - I have been thinking about looking in to Dart or perhaps Go</li>
	<li>Launch an Android app - Another holdover from last year I am thinking of doing a small app having to do with managing the silent state of the phone</li>
</ol>
