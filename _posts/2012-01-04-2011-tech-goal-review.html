<p>A year ago I wrote a post listing my professional goals for 2011.  I thought I would review them and see how I did.
<ol>
	<li>Release an Android app to the marketplace - Didn't do it.  In fact, haven't really touched Android much since I wrote that.  I still have some ideas but am not sure if I will get around to it.</li>
	<li>Contribute free software to the community - I did do this.  I have been collaborating with others via github more lately.</li>
	<li>Regularly attend a user group meetings outside of Java - Did not do this.  Family life being what it is makes this not that much of a priority right now.</li>
	<li>Obtain the Oracle Certified Web Developer Certification - Did not do this.  This is not much of a priority to me any more.</li>
	<li>Learn scala - I am about 50/50 on this one.  I read a few scala books but did not write an actual application.</li>
	<li>Write an app using JSF - Did not do this.  Still interested.</li>
	<li>Present at a user group meeting - I did a Maven presentation at the Java user group.</li>
	<li>Use git more, and more effectively - Definitely did this.  Using it on a daily basis now.</li>
</ol>
Overall, I got about halfway on my goals.  It's not too bad since I did do a few things that weren't on my list.
<ol>
	<li>Learned to develop applications using GWT and deploy them to Google App Engine</li>
	<li>Converted one of my sites from PHP to Ruby / Sinatra (learning to use it in the process)</li>
	<li>Studied up on the HTML 5 features and did a lot of Javascript development</li>
</ol>
