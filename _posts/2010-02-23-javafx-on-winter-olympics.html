<p>Though it may be old news for people following JavaFX closely, I have just run across the JavaFX application on the Winter Olympics website.&#160; Slick transitions and useful data make this a great example of what JavaFX can do.&#160; I think it's really cool that you can look at past olympics as well as the current year.</p>  <p>Maybe this will help generate a little buzz around JavaFX.</p>  <p><a href="http://www.vancouver2010.com/olympic-medals/geo-view/" target="_blank">Check out the application on vancouver2010.com</a></p>
