I thought it might be a good idea to post some professional goals for 2011.  Hopefully, I can look at this list at the end of the year and have accomplished most of them.
<ol>
	<li>Release an Android app to the marketplace - I figured I would put this first because I have one that I have been working on for a while and it is about ready.  Along with this, I would like to start another one and continue to develop my Android skills.</li>
	<li>Contribute free software to the community - Again, I have an SMF plugin that will fill this requirement nicely.  Just need to give it some polish and release it.  That's not all, I would like to add a few more libraries on github, or possibly contribute to an open source project.</li>
	<li>Regularly attend a user group meetings outside of Java - A great way to meet people and learn new things.</li>
	<li>Obtain the Oracle Certified Web Developer Certification - I got the SCJP a few years ago and would like to obtain another one.  One step closer to Certified Enterprise Architect.</li>
	<li>Learn scala - As a language geek, I like to stick to the Pragmatic Programmer's 'learn a new language every year' rule (last year was Ruby).  Scala presents some new concepts all wrapped in a JVM-based OOP language.  Time to dig in.</li>
	<li>Write an app using JSF - New JEE 6 features are pretty slick.  I want to really leverage them in an app.</li>
	<li>Present at a user group meeting - Last but not least, I would like to improve my public speaking and skills in presenting.  Also, is a great reason to dig in to some latest and greatest tech.</li>
	<li>Use git more, and more effectively - Trying to move all my personal projects from Subversion to Git.</li>
</ol>
That's it.  A little daunting, but I am confident I can at least touch on most of these and it's a great roadmap to my professional development.
