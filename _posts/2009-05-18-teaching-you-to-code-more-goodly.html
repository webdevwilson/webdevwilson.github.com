<p>Welcome to goodercode.com.  I have created this as a resource for web development professionals.  
The plan is to post useful tools, and tutorials focusing on coding or web development in general.   
Hopefully, these will be useful and enable you make you a more faster coder or at least save you one headache.</p>

<p>In the past, I posting these on my families personal blog (<a href="http://allthingswilson.com">http://allthingswilson.com</a>) 
but was ridiculed by friends and castigated by my wife.  Seems her family doesn't speak T-SQL or JSON!  
All they speak is pictures of kids and notes of what's going on.  Who wants to read that?</p>

<p>Check back in for some great, if not grammatically correct, crap.</p>
