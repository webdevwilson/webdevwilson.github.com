<script language="javascript" src="/js/syntaxhighlighter_2.1.364/scripts/shBrushSql.js"></script><script language="javascript" src="/js/syntaxhighlighter_2.1.364/scripts/shBrushPhp.js"></script><p>Sometimes I come across a time saver so useful that I feel compelled to share it. </p>  <p>Supposing we are keeping track of stats on our website in a MySQL database with a table of    <br />columns url, month, hits.&#160; To update the hit count we can do this: </p>

<pre class="brush: sql">
UPDATE `stats` SET `hits` = `hits` + 1 WHERE `url` = '/tips.htm' AND `month` = '6'
</pre>

<p>Now, this would work as long as we are assured the record exists.&#160; But, we can't be sure it exists. 
  <br />So we have to do the following: </p>

<pre class="brush: php">
   $results = query( "SELECT hits FROM `stats` WHERE url = '/tips.htm' AND month = '6'" ); 
   if( $results->count() == 0 ) { 
     // do insert 
     query("INSERT INTO `stats`( `url`, `month`, `hits` ) VALUES ( '/tips.htm', '6', 0 )"); 
     
   } else { 
    
     // do update 
     query("UPDATE `stats` SET `hits` = `hits` + 1 WHERE `url` = '/tips.htm' AND `month` = '6'"); 
   } 
</pre>

<p></p>

<p>However, this can be done in one query so long as url and month are setup as composite keys, and 
  <br />hits must default to 1.&#160; With a little setup the next query accomplishes everything in one fail swoop: </p>

<pre class="brush: php">
query("INSERT INTO `stats`( `url`, `month` ) VALUES ( '/tips.htm', '6' ) ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE `hits` = `hits` + 1"); 
</pre>

<p>Now do something productive with all the time you saved.&#160; Keep in mind that this syntax is valid in MySQL 4.1.0 and later.</p>
