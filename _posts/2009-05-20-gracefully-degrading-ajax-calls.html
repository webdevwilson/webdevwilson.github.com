<p>What happens if grandma fires up her Packard Bell and attempts to buy some medicinal ointment from 
    your site in IE 5?&#160; Or, what if one of your 3rd party advertisers (likely story) causes a 
    javascript error?&#160; Will your page still work?&#160; Have you ever thought of what happens 
    when javascript is not running on your fancy AJAX pages?</p>  <p>Not many of us do.&#160; But, 
    it is still important to think about what will happen if javascript is not running in the user's browser.&#160; Around 5% of user's have javascript completely turned off.&#160; Still other's may have security settings which disallow ajax calls or obsolete browser's which are not supported.&#160; Degrading your javascript gracefully can be tedious and time consuming.&#160;&#160; However, if you follow the pattern that I present it is hardly an inconvenience at all.</p>  <p><strong>Consider the following code:</strong></p>  

<pre>
   &lt;div class="book"&gt;
     &lt;a href="/book/details" onclick="ajax('/book/details','content'); return false;"&gt;Book Details&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Pretty simple.&#160; We can see that when the link is clicked an ajax call is made.&#160; The click 
    event returns false, preventing the browser from navigating to the href location.&#160; If 
    Javascript is not running the browser will just navigate to the '/book/details' page.</p>

<p>The next part is where most people might get lost.&#160; But, if you are using a modern 
    <a href="http://www.rabbitphp.org" target="_blank">MVC framework</a> (why wouldn't you be?), 
    then you should be fine.&#160; Or, at the very least, you should be implementing the view 
    decorator pattern in some form.</p>

<p>Basically, your controller (or page) should be able to detect whether or not the request was made 
    via AJAX, the XMLHttpRequest object.&#160; Most javascript libraries make this easy by adding a 
    special request header, 'X-Requested-With'.&#160; If your library does not do this, you should be 
    able to manually add the header.&#160; By checking this header, you can easily determine whether 
    it is AJAX you are dealing with.</p>

<p><strong>In PHP:</strong></p>

<pre>
     
     function isAjax() {
       return $_SERVER['HTTP_X_REQUESTED_WITH'] == 'XMLHttpRequest';
     }
     
     $book = Book-&gt;find($id);
     
     if( !isAjax() ) {
       include('includes/header.inc');
     }
    
   echo "
   &lt;div class="book"&gt;
     &lt;h1&gt;${book[title]&lt;/h1&gt;
     &lt;p&gt;${book[description]}&lt;/p&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
  ";
    
    if( !isAjax() ) {
      include('includes/footer.inc');
    }  
</pre>

<p>That is pretty straightforward, but the great thing is that most MVC frameworks will do it automatically!&#160; But, what if we want to automatically create our links.&#160; This is easy with the jquery library.&#160; We will create a method that will run when the page loads, and add automatically add the functionality to our links (designated with the ajaxme class).</p>

<pre>
   &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
     $(document).ready($('a.ajaxme').click( function() { 
       var url = $(this).attr('href');
       var div = '#'+$(this).attr('rel');
       $(div).load(url);
     }));
   &lt;/script&gt;
   &lt;div class="book"&gt;
      &lt;a href="/book/details" class="ajaxme" rel="content"&gt;Book Details&lt;/a&gt;
   &lt;/div&gt;
   &lt;div id="content"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>Keep in mind there are many situations where it is not possible to gracefully degrade an application.&#160; In these cases a &lt;noscript&gt; tag should be used to warn the user that they are missing out on additional functionality.</p>
